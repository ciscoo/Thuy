## Overview

The source for little notes to my girlfriend on the Internet. The notes are private and will not be uploaded, but everything else will. Built with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/),
[Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/), and [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com)

## Quickstart

Ensure you have [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed globally with `$ npm install -g gulp bower-cli`.
Also ensure you have Ruby, the DevKit, and Jekyll installed as well.

1. Clone the repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/ciscoo/thuy.git`
2. Run `$ npm install` to install all the `devDependencies`
3. Then `$ bower install` to install Susy.
4. Finally run `$ gulp` to launch the development server.
